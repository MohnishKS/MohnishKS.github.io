Summary
This research project aims to study, empirically, the impact of Federal interest rate (overnight rate) changes, which are announced by the US Federal Reserve (FOMC), on US stocks. For this study, stocks data was analysed for 12 companies across 8 industries, namely Technology, Finance, Energy, Infrastructure, Manufacturing, Auto, Retail, and Food. All these are public companies whose common stocks are traded on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The impact of six hikes in federal interest rates (or overnight lending rates) was analysed using the simple moving averages (SMA) of stock prices 30 days before the date of announcement of interest rate and comparing it with the 1/7/30/60/90 day moving day averages after the date of announcement. It was observed that many companies' stock price took the hit and declined immediately following the rate hike. However, there were still a few companies in certain industries whose stock price either remained statistically unchanged or slighted increased in the 1/7/30/60/90 days following the interest rate hike. 

In addition to studying the impact of interest rate changes when it was formally announced by the Fed, it would also be helpful to further study the impact starting when the speculations start about interest rate changes. Such speculations can also impact the stocks right away and not wait until the actual rate changes are formally announced or implemented. By then the impact is already baked in the stock prices, pending some market corrections. Other macroeconomic factors and company's individual performance and its financial ratios should also be considered further to accurately assess the impact of interest rates on a company or on an industry.
